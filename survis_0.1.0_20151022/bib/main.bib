ABSTRACT = {Lane changing systems have consistently received attention in the fields of vehicular communication and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a lane change system that combines deep reinforcement learning and vehicular communication. A host vehicle, trying to change lanes, receives the state information of the host vehicle and a remote vehicle that are both equipped with vehicular communication devices. A deep deterministic policy gradient learning algorithm in the host vehicle determines the high-level action of the host vehicle from the state information. The proposed system learns straight-line driving and collision avoidance actions without vehicle dynamics knowledge. Finally, we consider the update period for the state information from the host and remote vehicles.},

abstract = {Abstract Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is widely studied in both industrial and academic communities since it is regarded as a promising means for improving transportation safety and efficiency. Lane changing is a critical link for higher-level AV operations. However, few studies on AV lane changing consider the dynamics of surrounding vehicles, particularly in a mixed traffic environment including human-driven vehicles (HVs). Therefore, this article presents a dynamic lane-changing model for AV incorporating human driver behavior in mixed traffic. The proposed model includes four key components: car following (and lane keeping), lane-changing decision, dynamic trajectory generation, and model predictive control (MPC)-based trajectory tracking. AV longitudinal control algorithm is also depicted in detail in this article. Field experiments are conducted on a large-scale test track to test and validate the proposed model. An AV and three HVs are used in the lane-changing experiments. Different human driver behaviors are considered in the experiment settings. Experimental results show that the proposed lane-changing model can complete lane-changing maneuvers efficiently when HVs are cooperative and can also robustly abort them when HVs are uncooperative. Compared with the measured human lane-changing maneuvers, AV lane-changing maneuvers from the proposed model are more comfortable and safer.},

abstract = {Automated driving is gaining increasing amounts of attention from both industry and academic communities because it is regarded as the most promising technology for improving road safety in the future. The ability to make an automated lane change is one of the most important parts of automated driving. However, there has been little research into automated lane change maneuvers, and current research has not identified a way to avoid potential collisions during lane changes, which result from the state variations of the other vehicles. One important reason is that the lane change vehicle cannot acquire accurate information regarding the other vehicles, especially the vehicles in the adjacent lane. However, vehicle-to-vehicle communication has the advantage of providing more information, and this information is more accurate than that obtained from other sensors, such as radars and lasers. Therefore, we propose a dynamic automated lane change maneuver based on vehicle-to-vehicle communication to accomplish an automated lane change and eliminate potential collisions during the lane change process. The key technologies for this maneuver are trajectory planning and trajectory tracking. Trajectory planning calculates a reference trajectory satisfying the demands of safety, comfort and traffic efficiency and updates it to avoid potential collisions until the lane change is complete. The trajectory planning method converts the planning problem into a constrained optimization problem using the lane change time and distance. This method is capable of planning a reference trajectory for a normal lane change, an emergency lane change and a change back to the original lane. A trajectory-tracking controller based on sliding mode control calculates the control inputs to make the host vehicle travel along the reference trajectory. Finally, simulations and experiments using a driving simulator are conducted. They demonstrate that the proposed dynamic automated lane change maneuver can avoid potential collisions during the lane change process effectively.}
